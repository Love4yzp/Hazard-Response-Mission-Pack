# Hazard Response Mission Pack

The Hazard Response Mission Pack is an open-source AIoT solution designed to efficiently manage and mitigate hazard scenarios. This compact system combines a range of technologies, including sensor networks and edge computing, to enable effective remote sensing, data transmission, processing, inference, and analysis.

This initiative is not a market-ready product but rather a collaborative effort between Seeed and a global community of practitioners committed to using technology to tackle real-world challenges. We welcome contributions from individuals and organizations to explore the limitless potential of ‚Äútech for hazard response.‚Äù

## Documentation Overview

### 1. ‚≠êÔ∏è **[Jumpstart Guide](./docs/jumpstart-usage/README.md)**

Get started quickly with a hands-on introduction to the Mission Pack's features and capabilities.

### 2. ‚≠êÔ∏è **[Integrator Handbook](./docs/integrator-handbook/README.md)**

A comprehensive guide for integrators, providing detailed instructions on how to customize and deploy the Mission Pack effectively.

## Node-RED Flows

There are a collection of Node-RED flows contributed by the community and Seeed Studio. It serves as a platform for sharing and continuously integrating new features into the Mission Pack, enabling the extension and enhancement of its functionalities.

### Function - Snippets

This section contains various sample applications and Node-RED flow snippets designed to showcase specific functions and use cases. These snippets can be used as building blocks to develop more complex flows.

For more information, see the [Function README](./functions/README.md).

### Examples - Functional Nodes

Here, you will find examples of functional nodes that handle incoming and outgoing data from devices. This section also includes application cases that rely on global and subflow nodes, providing essential dependencies for building robust flows.

For more information, see the [Example README](./examples/README.md).

### Projects

This section features comprehensive application cases implemented through Node-RED flows. Each project demonstrates one or multiple scenarios, providing practical examples of how Node-RED can be used to solve real-world problems.

For more information, see the [Projects README](./projects/README.md).
