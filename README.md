### Description:

Hazard Response Mission Pack is an ongoing research project designed for optimized disaster preparedness[1], management, and response. 

This pack includes robust devices for data transmission, data processing,  user interface, precise tracking, intelligent visual analysis, and custom sensor development for environmental monitoring. On top of that we have added new chat based local devices to create better communications among offline, offgrid users, based on [meshtastic](http://meshtastic.org/)

Hazard scenarios, ranging from industrial accidents to natural disasters, present complex challenges that require swift and accurate management to minimize risk and damage. The world is lacking applicable, scalable, and easy-to-deploy solutions that might be helpful for solving challenges in these scenarios.

At Seeed Studio, we believe that the key to achieving a sustainable future lies in our ability to strike a balance between protecting humans from nature, while also protecting nature from humans. AIoT plays a crucial role in achieving this delicate balance, by allowing us to harness the power of technology to better understand and adapt to our environment.

[1] WFP defines emergency preparedness as “Actions, arrangements, and procedures in anticipation of an emergency to ensure that the response when needed, be rapid, appropriate and effective.” (Source: [WFP’s Programme Guidance Manual, page 10](https://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/resources/wfp251892.pdf))
